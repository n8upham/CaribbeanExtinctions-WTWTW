R code to reproduce the binomial results. Address all queries to liliana.davalos@stonybrook.edu

1) Both data files should be in the same folder as the scripts, or else modify to give file paths,

2) pre_processing.r organizes the data and runs preliminary binomial models,

3) phylo_phyr_binomial_v3.r runs all binomial models (from a saved RData file that must be in same folder),

4) summarize_phyr_binomial_v3.r summarizes all binomial models (from a saved RData file that must be in same folder),

5) summarize_get_mass_v3.r extracts imputed mass values for Hexolobodontinae_x.
